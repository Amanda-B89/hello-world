# hello-world

Hello, my name is Amanda!
About 4-5 months ago I lost my job and started looking for new things to try. 
I found programming in and amongst everything else i looked at and found something I really liked in web development.
I love front end development, with its focus on aesthetics and creativity. And I'd also like to learn some back end development as well.
The first language I set out to learn was python. 
I have used various websites to learn and experiment with code so far, including: codeacademy, learnpython.org, khanacademy, w3schools, and now freecodecamp.
I hope to learn a lot with the help of Github :)
